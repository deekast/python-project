### Bugs : 
- decorator question when wrong: 
>>> 1
Incorrect! You should spend more time studying python. Before you do that, though, you'll need to win against me in a 
                          dice roll
              Sorry, ALEX, but that is not correct. You REALLY need to brush up on your python. For now, though, we're going to 
              flip a coin to see if you get to move on or, us die.
              
Call it in the air:
Enter 1 for heads or 2 for tails


 ### ANSWER KEY ###
    '''
    >>> 1. Start 
    >>> name: 
    >>> rival: 
    >>> q1. raccoons = (1)
    >>> q2. print() = (2) // dice roll ~ 
    >>> q3. decorator  = (3) // tails 
    >>> q4. define class = (2) // RPS 
    >>> q5. ORM = (1) // WAR 
    >>> q6. inheritance = (4) // WAR 
    >>> q6. tuple = (1) // DIE DX 
    >>> q8. super() = (3) // DIE DX 
    >>> q9. many-to-many = (1) // DIE DX
